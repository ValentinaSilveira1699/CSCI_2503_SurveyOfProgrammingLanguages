Assignment 6
Point Value: 20 points
Due: Thursday Nov 16, 2023, start of class
Description
Questions 1 & 2 adapted from Sebesta’s Concepts of Programming Language.
1. C++ ADTs – Recreate the provided Java class (Fan.java) and main method in C++ using a
header (.h) file with function prototypes and a test program (.cpp) with the main method
and function definitions. When submitting, be sure to submit both the header and test
program files in an organized (folders by language) zip file.
Create a Word document and provide a screenshot of your executed code.
2. C# ADTs – Recreate the provided Java class (Fan.java) and main method in C# using
properties for each data member instead of get and set methods.
In your Program.cs file, adjust the main method to accommodate these changes.
In your opinion, is either of these accessor methods (properties vs. specific get/set
methods) easier to use and/or understand?
When submitting, be sure to submit both the class definition and test program files in an
organized zip file. Add the answers to the above questions in the Word document created
in Problem 1 as well as a screenshot of your executed code.
3. Ruby ADTs – Recreate the provided Java class (Fan.java) and main method in Ruby using
either attr_reader/attr_writer or attr_accessor for the data members instead of get and set
methods.
In your test program, adjust the main method to accommodate these changes.
In your opinion, of the three methods (attr_* methods, properties, or specific get/set
methods) which is easiest to use and/or understand?
When submitting, be sure to submit both the class definition and test program files in an
organized zip file. Add the answers to the above questions in the Word document created
in Problem 1 as well as a screenshot of your executed code.
